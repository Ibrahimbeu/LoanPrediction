## Loan Prediction Model
This project aims to develop a loan prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model is designed to predict whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on various features and historical data.
<br>
## Project Overview
The loan prediction model is built using machine learning algorithms to analyze historical loan application data and predict the likelihood of approval or denial for future loan applications. By deploying this model, users can make informed decisions about loan applications, helping lenders assess risks and improve their loan approval process.

This project provides the necessary code and instructions to train the model, evaluate its performance, and deploy it for real-time predictions.


## Model Training

To train the loan prediction model, follow these steps:

- Prepare your loan application dataset by following the preprocessing steps and ensuring the dataset matches the required format.
- Replace the placeholder data with your own dataset in the training code files.
- Choose one of the following classifiers: KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, or RandomForestClassifier.
